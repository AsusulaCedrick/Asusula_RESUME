       Personal Portfolio Website

            Project Title
"Cedrick Asusula - Personal Portfolio Website"

          Project Description

This is the portfolio website of mine which I have personally designed and developed as a 3rd-year IT student at PUP Quezon City. 
It tells the story of me and what I am capable of as a developer and a designer. The portfolio of mine is available via a neat and mobile-friendly layout in which users can learn about 
who am i, my skills, projects, achievements, and contact information. This site is an artifact of my development and enthusiasm as a UI/UX designer, web developer, and app designer.
I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create it in a way that demonstrates both my artistic side and my technical ​‍​‌‍​‍‌capabilities.
